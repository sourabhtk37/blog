      <description>Devconf is an annual developers conference organized by Red Hat attended by students, professionals and enthusiasts alike focusing on FOSS. It was a 2-day event organized in Christ university like last year. Being a part of Red Hat, it was definitely a plus for me to attend Devconf. Simply because it felt like a day out with other Red Hatters. I have also attended last year&amp;rsquo;s Devconf but this year I was speaking as well.</description>

      <description>Being a heavy console user I would like to have the ability to control everything right from the vincity of the 80*25px window to the world. This post is one such attempts to share whatever things I find and share the configurations with others trying to find the solution for the same.
Now I have an old bluetooth speaker that I want to use to listen to some light music in the background.</description>

      <description>I have recently started using i3wm on a full-time basis. Previously, I have been using KDE plasma (checkout KDE connect if using KDE plasma).
This post is simply to share some of the common configs that one might need to add after booting into i3 for the first time. The settings for i3 configs are mostly found at ~/.config/i3/config, if not copy from /etc/i3/config.
Meta Key I am using windows or host as Meta key.</description>

      <description>From the 100s or 200s of suspended chrome tabs, I opened one of the tabs to make some progress (Imma yuuge procrastinator). This was a LWN article of a talk on Memory use in CPython and MicroPython by Kavya Joshi at PyCon &amp;lsquo;17 (USA). You can find the video of the talk here. It&amp;rsquo;s a great talk.
The talk contrasts two reference implementation of python:
 CPython MicroPython  Even though both are implementation of python but they are quite opposite with respect to the memory usage.</description>

      <description>I was at the Ilug-D meet-up, while talking about this blog a friend asked me:
 Why the need for HTTPS in a blog?
 I couldn&amp;rsquo;t answer it accurately. To answer the question accurately, understanding two things is enough:

      <title>Setting Brightness To Absolute Value</title>

      <description>Like me most you have habit to &amp;ldquo;rage into the dark night&amp;rdquo; with backlit keyboards, f.lux or redshift and what-nots. I find the lowest brightness of the display, attained by pressing the F11 key, to be brighter than my taste.
So I checked if it&amp;rsquo;s possible to set the brightness level to some value since everything in unix is a file.
Ofcourse it is, lemme show you&amp;hellip;
